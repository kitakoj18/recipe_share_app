React Native social-media type application where users can share and view posts related to recipes they and their friends have made. 

Users can login and from there view their friends' posts and the pictures and details related to each recipe in the post, and post their own recipes by including pictures and details. 

Implements React-Navigation, Redux/Redux Thunk and other various React-Native API's to open camera and take pictures, etc. 

Makes API calls to express.js REST API backend that I created [here](https://github.com/kitakoj18/recipe_share_app_backend) to set up user authentication, and to fetch/post user posts.
